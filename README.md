A great way to show your kids and neighbors you're not some sort of irrelevant, middle-aged work-drone, has-been Gen X'er stuck 
in the olden days of baseball cards and Commodores. Take out your phone and challenge them 
to a game of one-on-one basketball. Or better yet, take the whole office! 

You bet Lisa from accounting will be impressed by your smooth street cred moves you picked up from watching
re-runs of choice Shaq dunks on YouTube last night. 

Completed in early June 2016 while taking the refresher [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) course, [Android Development for Beginners](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-development-for-beginners--ud837),
this slick app will take care of tracking the scores of your basketball game so you can focus on what matters: landing those
wicked three-pointer shots.
